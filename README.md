# BuzzKill Arduino Library

The BuzzKill Arduino library is available here in raw form or as a .zip file.

The easiest way to install the library is to download the BuzzKill-Arduino-Library.zip file to your computer, open the Ardiono IDE, navigate to Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library, and select the BuzzKill-Arduino-Library.zip file you just downloaded. This will automatically unpack and install the library files into your local libraries folder, making the library available to use in your sketches.

Once installed, be sure to check out the supplied example sketches. From the Arduino IDE, just go to File -> Examples -> BuzzKill and choose from the available sample sketches which demonstrate the library functionality.

NOTE: On older versions of the Arduino IDE it may be necessary to re-start the IDE before the examples will be listed in the menu.
